# Blynk MQTT client for HTML5 / JavaScript

HTML5, combined with WebSockets, provides a powerful duo for building real-time, interactive
web interfaces for IoT Edge and Embedded Systems. This combination enables the creation of
web applications that can communicate efficiently with IoT devices in real-time, facilitating
seamless user interaction with the device's data and operations. It is widely used in creating
dashboards for monitoring and controlling IoT devices, offering a platform-agnostic approach
that works across various devices and browsers, enhancing the user experience in IoT ecosystems.
